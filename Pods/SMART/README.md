Swift-SMART is a full client implementation of the üî•FHIR specification for building apps that interact with healthcare data through [**SMART on FHIR**][smart].
Written in _Swift 3_ it is compatible with **iOS 8** and **OS X 10.10** and newer and requires Xcode 8 or newer.


### Versioning

Due to the complications of combining two volatile technologies, here's an overview of which version numbers use which **Swift** and **FHIR versions**.

- The [`master`](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-SMART) branch should always compile and is on (point releases of) these main versions.
- The [`develop`](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-SMART/tree/develop) branch should be on versions corresponding to the latest freezes and may be updated from time to time with the latest and greatest CI build.

See [tags/releases](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-SMART/releases).

QuickStart
----------

See [the programming guide][wiki] for more code examples and details.

The following is the minimal setup working against our reference implementation.
It is assuming that you don't have a `client_id` and on first authentication will **register the client with our server**, then proceed to retrieve a token.
If you know your client-id you can specify it in the settings dict.
The app must also register the `redirect` URL scheme so it can be notified when authentication completes.

```swift
import SMART

// create the client
let smart = Client(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://fhir-api-dstu2.smarthealthit.org")!,
    settings: [
        //"client_id": "my_mobile_app",       // if you have one
        "redirect": "smartapp://callback",    // must be registered
    ]
)

// authorize, then search for prescriptions
smart.authorize() { patient, error in
    if nil != error || nil == patient {
        // report error
    }
    else {
        MedicationOrder.search(["patient": patient!.id])
        .perform(smart.server) { bundle, error in
            if nil != error {
                // report error
            }
            else {
                var meds = bundle?.entry?
                    .filter() { return $0.resource is MedicationOrder }
                    .map() { return $0.resource as! MedicationOrder }
                
                // now `meds` holds all the patient's orders (or is nil)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For authorization to work with Safari/SFViewController, you also need to:

1. register the scheme (such as `smartapp` in the example here) in your app's `Info.plist` and
2. intercept the callback in your app delegate, like so:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    
    func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL,
        options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        
        // "smart" is your SMART `Client` instance
        if smart.awaitingAuthCallback {
            return smart.didRedirect(to: url)
        }
        return false
    }
}
```


Installation
------------

The suggested approach is to add _Swift-SMART_ as a git submodule to your project.
Find detailed instructions on how this is done on the [Installation page][installation].

The framework can also be installed via _Carthage_ and is also available via _CocoaPods_ under the name [‚ÄúSMART‚Äù][pod].
